        Porter’s relationship with fame is especially pointed because he didn’t
        set out to be a star. In fact, he started making music as a kid to add
        other people’s music to a Dance Dance Revolution emulator. In order to
        do that, though, he accidentally taught himself production basics and
        was soon making tracks on his mum’s computer using whatever software he
        could torrent. “My initial ambition was never superstardom. It was never
        arenas or playing Coachella; I was just seeking the smallest nuggets of
        recognition. There was never a plan to become a pop star, I just
        constantly found the next step so insanely exciting,” he says, which
        quickly led to Porter Robinson performing on massive festival stages and
        DJing at his own Las Vegas residency as EDM took over the world. That
        rapid rise didn’t sit right with him, though. While performing at a
        festival in Australia, he started dissociating and decided he’d had
        enough of EDM. He began berating audiences and slating the scene in
        interviews as he tried to grow beyond the bro-heavy scene. In one
        infamous encounter with NME, he claimed EDM wasn’t art, just
        entertainment. “That was so wrongheaded,” he admits today. “I haven’t
        felt like an EDM artist for a decade now, but I still get categorised
        that way,” he adds with a sigh, still unable to shake off the label.
        “The thing I’ll say is, I’m not going to turn my nose up to anyone that
        wants to listen to my music, if they find value or meaning in it. If the
        rest of what they’re listening to is mainstage dance music, but then
        they can hear a song like ‘Blossom’ and cry, there’s beauty in that.”

        Porter also understands the fans begging him for a return to older eras
        because he’s felt the same way about plenty of his own faves. “I’ve made
        art for long enough now that I know that you can’t go back, though. I’ve
        seen enough artists try to appease their audience by making the music
        they think their fans want to hear, and it always sucks. It’s this
        hollow, thin, nostalgia thing. You can always feel that lack of
        sincerity,” he offers. “Anyway, most of the time, it’s not the music you
        miss; it’s who you were when you heard that music for the first time.”
        “It’s never been about shock value, though. That’s just so boring,” he
        says of a decade of hard pivots. Instead, Porter has always just chased
        what felt the most exciting. A lot of ‘SMILE :D’ came about after he
        picked up a guitar, fell in love with the “greatest songwriting tool
        ever discovered”, and figured he should probably do his homework. There
        are nods to noughties rock, the Warped Tour scene and MySpace-era bands
        like Hellogoodbye, Lights and Never Shout Never across the record. It
        was never about nostalgia, though. “In 2010, I was only listening to
        Daft Punk and electronic music. The closest I got to guitar music was
        Justice,” he says, once deleting an illegally downloaded version of LCD
        Soundsystem’s ‘Daft Punk Are Playing At My House’ before the track had
        even finished, just because of how raw it sounded. There’s also a touch
        of hyperpop to the record, thanks to 100gecs. “I saw them at a festival,
        and it just clicked for me. It wasn’t this inside joke like I thought it
        was; it was something everyone could enjoy,” he says, describing ‘Knock
        Yourself Out XD’ as a mix between the brash subgenre and Weezer. “I was
        trying to make something that was anthemic and electronic. I don’t get
        the ‘Cheerleader’ hyperpop accusations, though,” he continues. “To me,
        that song sounds like The Killers, but whatever, you can’t prevent
        misunderstandings.” Porter goes on to describe ‘SMILE :D’ as a love
        letter to cliché. “For something to become a cliché, it has to resonate
        so widely with all of humanity,” he offers. It’s one of the reasons he
        declares “Bitch, I’m Taylor Swift” on ‘Knock Yourself Out XD.’ “‘All Too
        Well (10 Minute Version)’ is ten minutes of the most widely used chord
        progression of all time, but it’s so beautiful. Her songwriting and the
        stories she tells are what makes her music so powerful.” Across ‘SMILE
        :D’, Porter uses the most “basic, non-jazzy” chords, synth patterns, and
        drum fills. “I’m certainly not trying to prove that I’m like a great
        singer or guitarist with this album,” he adds. ‘SMILE :D’, as the
        smirking name suggests, is a record of joy. Yes, the lyrics pick apart
        the dark sides of fame, but it’s never cynical. “‘Nurture’ was me trying
        to fight the nihilism. I was attempting to inject meaning and hope into
        people’s lives at a time that felt really hopeless and meaningless,”
        says Porter. “With ‘SMILE :D’, there’s more acceptance of the state of
        things and having fun with that. But I don’t accept meaninglessness; I
        don’t accept nihilism. I think the shit that we do on this planet
        matters.”

        There’s a jaggedness across ‘SMILE :D’ that hasn’t been present in any
        of his other, more pristine projects. “K-pop is so aspirational and
        speaks to a desire for greatness and perfection, but a lot of what
        speaks to me is music where the heart is bleeding. I think that’s
        probably true for a lot of people who come to Porter Robinson for their
        albums as well,” he says. It’s a few weeks before ‘Knock Yourself Out
        XD’ is due to be released, and Porter Robinson is “feeling the pressure”
        despite loving every track on ‘SMILE :D’. “Maybe I’m just the kind of
        person who’s prone to negative emotions,” he offers. It would explain
        why so much of his career has been about finding connection and
        understanding. “I’ve been fighting against that recently,” he explains.
        “This album is more about being seen because I think being understood is
        ultimately impossible. All I can really do as an artist is share my
        feelings and hope that they resonate with people in some way. There
        really is no grander design for this record.” Porter can’t stop thinking
        about playing these new songs live. “Some of it is so high energy and
        fun, but there’s also something about singing vulnerable words that
        would usually be hard to say in a room with 10,000 other people. All of
        it fills my heart with extreme joy and anticipation.” The 70-date ‘SMILE
        :D’ world tour kicks off in August and will keep Porter busy until at
        least early 2025. “I want it to be unbelievably playful and celebratory.
        I’m going to play every song of mine that I love,” he promises. “Can I
        sound self-absorbed for a second? I love my discography. I love the
        music I’ve made.” ‘SMILE :D’ is the first Porter Robinson record that
        hasn’t really had anything to kick back against. “I don’t feel like I’ve
        got much to prove on this. I’m just doing my thing,” he says. Look at
        his career as a whole, and the uniting factor is exploration and play.
        “Maybe this is me embracing another cliche, but everything I do is a
        love letter of some kind,” he continues. “The thing that’s worked for me
        is leaning wholeheartedly into whatever is the most exciting thing and
        doing that without compromise.”

        The track, produced by Dan Nigro, arrives alongside a music video
        directed by Danica Kleinknecht and co-starring Corey Fogelmanis. Shot on
        Kodak 35mm 500t in Texas, it continues the narrative established in the
        video for previous single ‘This Song’, following the story of Wilson &
        Brandon. ‘Wishbone’, Gray’s fourth studio album, is set for release on
        15th August via Island EMI. Gray will support the release with a North
        American tour, including his first performance at Red Rocks
        Amphitheatre, before concluding with his debut shows in Mexico.
